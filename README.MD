Inspired by UFO by Dynatrace. This repository contains the firmware for an arduino nano connected to an ENC28J60 ethernet shield. The UFO has 2 LED rings connected with 15 LEDs and can be controlled over network.

It also contains a standalone java application which is highly extensible and collects the state from a build server like hudson or bamboo. The current build state is published to the LED rings of the UFO.
